Intercom on product management is a blog post from Intercom, a customer communication platform, that provides guidance to product managers on how to better manage their product.


The blog post outlines five key principles for success: understanding customer needs, building for the future, launching with purpose, measuring progress, and embracing change.


It stresses the importance of aligning customer needs with product features and emphasizes the need for product managers to stay ahead of the curve by innovating and evolving the product to meet customer needs.


Additionally, the blog post encourages product managers to measure progress through analytics, feedback, and user testing, and to be open to changing the product if customers are not responding as desired.
