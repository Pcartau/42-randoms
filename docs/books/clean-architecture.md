# Clean Architecture

### [Download book](./documents/clean-architecture.pdf)

Clean Architecture, by Robert C. Martin, is a book about software architecture that promotes software that is decoupled from external influences such as the user interface, database, web, and other frameworks.

Martin argues that by keeping the core business logic separate from the external influences, code will be easier to maintain and test, as well as more resilient to changes in the user interface or other external influences.

He outlines several principles and practices for achieving this goal, including the use of dependency inversion and keeping high-level policy decisions separate from the details of implementation. He also discusses the use of hexagonal architecture and microservices architectures, as well as the importance of using well-defined interfaces between components.
