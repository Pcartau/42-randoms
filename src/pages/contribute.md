# Contribute

One of the main aims of the site is that it evolves over time and through the 42 community.

To contribute you must be a student at 42. Then you can make a pull request on this [Github](https://github.com/Pcartau/42-randoms), including your content (the resources are in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) format).

Once accepted, your resource will be added to the site. You can of course add credits by including your 42 profile.
